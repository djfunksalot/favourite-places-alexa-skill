# Favourite Places Skill

A quick day 1 skill to demo (in alexa-sdk) the new Alexa dialog models, Alexa skill builder, and particularly the `delegate` directive, which seems particularly useful. I bumped into a few bugs on the way which I plan to submit to Amazon.

See [alexa-sdk](https://github.com/alexa/alexa-skills-kit-sdk-for-nodejs) and [my other, bigger and better Alexa skill](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/alexa-room-booker) for more actual documentation.
